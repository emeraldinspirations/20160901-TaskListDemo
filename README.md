firstIterationIdentifier - A class in emeraldinspirations library
========================================

A quick way to determine the first iteration of a loop

This class is used in a loop operation to track if it is the first iteration 
of said loop.  Alternately, this class can also be passed a value in each
iteration and only the first value will be retained.

See [Output from phpDoc](https://github.com/emeraldinspirations/lib-firstIterationIdentifier/blob/master/phpDoc/index.html) for more information and documentation.
